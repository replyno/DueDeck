          </div>

        <b>General</b>
        <p>Welcome to the DueDeck website (as further defined below, the “Service” and “Site”), an online
            service designed and offered by Eligo Apptech Private Limited (as further defined below, the “Eligo”)
            This policy covers use of personal information that DueDeck collects when you use DueDeck.com
            website and all associated websites.
            At Eligo, we value our customers’ trust and committed to maintaining your privacy. We have set out
            below how we go about doing this.
            We strive to support business owners like you by offering the easiest, fastest way to manage your
            money and work practices, while respecting your privacy expectations and protecting your personal
            information (“Personal Information”).
            To demonstrate our commitment to protecting your privacy, we have developed this Privacy Policy,
            which describes how we will collect, use, disclose, retain and protect Personal Information in order
            to provide you with our online accounting and payroll services (the “Service”). Our Privacy Policy is
            based on applicable privacy legislation.</p>
            <b>Privacy Policy</b>
                <b>Identifying Purposes</b>
            <p>DueDeck collects, uses, and discloses Personal Information only for the purposes of providing you
            with our Service and as consented to, by you, as a DueDeck user.</p>

            <b>Personal Information</b>
           <p> To provide you with our Service. For example, in order to allow us to retrieve your banking
            information for use within the DueDeck application, we collect your online banking details (i.e.
            account number, IFSC Code, Bank Name, Branch Name for details).
            To offer you products and services that may be relevant to you and your business. When you are
            using our Service, you may be provided with relevant savings opportunities and related links based
            on information related to your use of the Service. DueDeck will use your Personal Information for
            the purpose of tailoring savings opportunities to your interests. However, we will never share your
            Personal Information with companies offering the savings opportunities. We only provide these
            companies with non-identifiable, aggregate information (e.g. the number of times one of their
            savings opportunities was clicked).
            To contact you via email for the purposes of product information, service updates, newsletters and
            tailored savings opportunity messages. We will never sell your email address to a third party.
            To monitor system usage, server and software performance, to improve system design, to create
            benchmarks and to conduct trending analyses. However, We will only use non-identifiable,
            aggregate information (e.g. number of users and transactions) for these purposes.
            To assist you with technical support issues. It is important to remember that most technical issues
            can be resolved without a DueDeck customer service representative viewing your Personal
            Information.
            To comply with any applicable law, regulation, subpoena or other legal process</p>

            <b>Consent</b>

            <p>We take a consent-based approach to the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information. We
            collect Personal Information directly from you and only obtain Personal Information from other
            organizations (e.g., your bank) when you provide us with the account numbers, passwords or other
            credentials required to retrieve the Personal Information and for the purpose of providing you with
            our Service. We use and disclose the Personal Information only as described in this policy and our
            Terms of Use.
            At any time and without penalty, DueDeck users can withdraw their consent and close their
            DueDeck service by stopping the subscription to the service
            Once your account is closed, all identifiable Personal Information relating to your account will be
            deleted from our systems. However, anonymous transactional data (which does not personally
            identify you or any of your employees, agents, contractors and representatives) will be retained in
            our database.
            At any time, DueDeck users can opt-out of most email communication from us by clicking on the
            opt-out link at the bottom of our emails. However, we may still contact you for administrative
            purposes (e.g. if there is a problem with your account or an anticipated service interruption).
            Withdrawing your consent will not apply to actions Eligo has already taken based on your prior
            consent
            In order to use certain Services, such as our salary processing service, you may be required to
            provide personal information relating to your employees, agents, contractors and representatives
            from time to time. You acknowledge, and represent to us that you only collect, use and disclose
            personal information in compliance with applicable privacy laws. You further represent and warrant
            to us that you have obtained all required consents from your employees, agents, contractors and
            representatives whose personal information will be disclosed to us or to our third party service
            providers in connection with the Services. You further agree to indemnify and hold us harmless for
            any loss, cost, complaint, damage, claim or liability whatsoever arising from your collection, use and
            disclosure of personal information relating to your employees, agents, contractors and
            representatives</p>

            <b>Limiting Collection</b>
            <p>We limit the collection of Personal Information by collecting only the information required to fulfil
            the identified purposes of the Service, such as user email address and password. Eligo may require
            you to disclose additional Personal Information relating to your employees, agents, contractors and
            representatives, including your employee&#39;s names, addresses, hours worked and rates of pay, for the
            purposes of offering our payroll Service. We will collect only the minimum amount of information
            required to facilitate the Service. However, our application provides you with the option of sharing
            additional information (e.g., your name or address) to enhance your use of the Service.
            When you use certain Services, you have the option to share information with other accounts you
            have signed up for.</p>

            <b>Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention</b>
            <p>Eligo will not use or disclose Personal Information for purposes other than the identified purposes of
            the Service.

            We also ensure that only those employees responsible for the Service’s operations have physical or
            technical access to Personal Information and only where such access is required to perform work
            authorized by their supervisors.
            We will retain Personal Information only for the duration of your enrolment as a DueDeck user and
            Personal Information will be retained in secure and segregated databases. If you choose to withdraw
            from the Service, we will securely destroy your Personal Information in our possession and control
            within 30 days unless we are required to retain such Personal Information longer to fulfil our
            obligations to you or to third parties. However, we may retain aggregate, non-personally identifiable
            information indefinitely.
            We retain Personal Information on our secure servers, and will, upon request, describe to you how
            you can obtain information about our trusted third party service providers’ privacy practices. Our
            third party service providers, including financial institutions, have their own terms of use and privacy
            policies that will govern your relationship with these third parties. You are responsible for reviewing
            and understanding these terms of use and policies.</p>

            <b>Storage of Online Banking Credentials</b>
            <p>You may choose to provide your online banking information, for the purpose of importing
            transactions into Eligo and reducing your manual entry workload. To provide improved security and
            reliability, Eligo employs a respected provider of global online banking solutions. This partner stores
            account and password information. Eligo does not store these.</p>

            <b>Accuracy</b>
            <p>DueDeck relies on you to ensure that the Personal Information you enter into our system is as
            accurate, complete and up-to-date as necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used. You are
            welcome to make changes or corrections to Personal Information at any time.
            We also make every effort to ensure the accuracy of the information in our reports, displays, articles
            and support queries. However, you must verify all information created from your use of the Service
            and we recommend that you consult an accounting professional before completing any government
            or regulatory filing or otherwise relying upon the information, as the use of this information is at
            your own risk.
            You are responsible for ensuring that that the information you have entered into our system is
            truthful, accurate, reliable and complete.</p>

            <b>Safeguards</b>
            <p>Eligo and our third-party service providers implement industry best practices appropriate to the
            sensitivity of your Personal Information. We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to
            protect your Personal Information against loss, theft, and unauthorized access, use, disclosure,
            copying, modification, disposal, or destruction in accordance with applicable legal requirements and
            industry best practices.
            For example, we implement encryption and security controls to protect against unauthorized access
            to Personal Information during electronic transmission and storage, and we train our employees to
            follow privacy and security practices specific to the Service. We also undertake security assessments
            to ensure that we maintain strong security controls.

            We ensure that any third party acting on our behalf in respect of your Personal Information
            maintains reasonable and appropriate safeguards. For example, these third parties classify customer
            account data as “super sensitive”. This means that access to such data is strictly limited based on
            business need and this data cannot be transmitted without the use of approved encryption
            methods. These third parties also employ both an Intrusion Detection System and an Intrusion
            Prevention System, and run regular network vulnerability scans. Additional information about our
            third parties’ privacy practices is available upon request.</p>

            <b>Openness</b>
            <p>Eligo makes clear and transparent notice of its privacy practices publicly available via our Privacy
            Commitment and this policy. Our notices describe the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of
            Personal Information and provide the contact information of our privacy contact person.
            We will advise you at the first reasonable opportunity upon discovering or being advised of an
            incident where your personal information is lost, stolen, accessed, used, disclosed, copied, modified
            or disposed of by unauthorized persons or in an unauthorized manner.</p>

            <b>Individual Access</b>
            <p>You own your data and can download your own data via the DueDeck website at any time. Upon
            request, We will also provide you with a list of the entities (e.g. third party service providers) to
            whom We have disclosed your Personal Information.</p>

            <b>Additional Site Features</b>
            <p>Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs and community forums. You should be aware that any
            information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.
            We take no responsibility for any information which you or your employees, agents, contractors and
            representatives post or publish on our site and you agree to indemnify and hold us harmless for any
            loss, cost, complaint, damage, claim or liability whatsoever arising from any such post or publication.

            <b>Cookies</b>
            <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. A
